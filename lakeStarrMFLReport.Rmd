# Executive Summary

This report describes the development of proposed Minimum and Guidance levels for Lake Starr in Polk County, Florida based on reevaluation of levels in Southwest Florida Water Management District rules that became effective August 2000. Minimum levels are the levels at which further water withdrawals would be significantly harmful to the water resources of the are (Section 373.042(1)(b), F.S.). Adopted minimum levels are used to support water resource planning and permitting activities. Adopted guidance levels are used as advisory guidelines for construction of lake shore development, water dependent structures, and operation of water management structures.

Section 373.0421(3), F.S., requires the periodic reevaluation and, as needed, the revision of established minimum flows and levels. Lake Starr was selected for reevaluation based on development of modeling tools for simulating lake level fluctuation that are not available when levels currently adopted for the lake were developed. The adopted lake levels were also reevaluated so support ongoing assessments of minimum flows and levels in the northern Tampa Bay Water Use Caution Area, a region of the District where recovery strategies are being implemented to support recovery to minimum flow and level thresholds.

# Introduction

This report describes the development of proposed Minimum and Guidance levels for Lake Starr in Polk County, Florida based on reevaluation of levels in Southwest Florida Water Management District rules that became effective August 2000. Minimum levels are the levels at which further water withdrawals would be significantly harmful to the water resources of the are (Section 373.042(1)(b), F.S.). Adopted minimum levels are used to support water resource planning and permitting activities. Adopted guidance levels are used as advisory guidelines for construction of lake shore development, water dependent structures, and operation of water management structures.

Section 373.0421(3), F.S., requires the periodic reevaluation and, as needed, the revision of established minimum flows and levels. Lake Starr was selected for reevaluation based on development of modeling tools for simulating lake level fluctuation that are not available when levels currently adopted for the lake were developed. The adopted lake levels were also reevaluated so support ongoing assessments of minimum flows and levels in the northern Tampa Bay Water Use Caution Area, a region of the District where recovery strategies are being implemented to support recovery to minimum flow and level thresholds.

## Lake Settings and Description

Lake Starr is located in Polk County, Florida (sections 14 and 23, Township 29 South, Range 27 East) in the PEace River Basin of the Southwest Floirda Water management District (Figure XX). 

There were several surficial wells surrounds Lake Starr that were used in the water budget. The surficial well with the most extensive period of record to the north and south of Lake Starr were used. The Hart UFA well was chosen to represent the upper Floridan. Given the steep contour of the UFA in the vicinity of Lake Starr, the elevations were increased by four feet to adjust to the UFA surface at the centroid of the lake.

```

# Results
Several of the hydrologic techincal methods are used and consolidated to determine the MFL for Lake Starr. These methods include the water budget model and the rainfall regression model. The water budget model was used to build a conceptual framework for Lake Starr using the available data and physical processes that represent movement of water from and to the lake. 
## Water Budget
The Lake Starr water budget was built over the period 1988-2012. Lake elevation data was available over this period at a daily continuous increment.

variableLinePlot("levelLakeStarrOrig", "Level (ft, NGVD29)")
```

my.summary <- function(x, na.rm=TRUE){
  result <- c(Mean=mean(x, na.rm=na.rm),
              SD=sd(x, na.rm=na.rm),
              Median=median(x, na.rm=na.rm),
              Min=min(x, na.rm=na.rm),
              Max=max(x, na.rm=na.rm), 
              N=length(x))
}
splitDF <- split(meltdf, f = meltdf$variable)
summaryWB <- t(sapply(splitDF, function(x) my.summary(x$value)))

The Upper Floridan aquifer well near Lake Starr was filled using Romp 57 to present a more complete dataset for the water budget model.

```{r plotUFA, fig.cap="Hart UFA well near Lake Starr"}
variableLinePlot(c("levelUFAHartFilled","levelUFAHartFilled4Feet"), "Level (ft, NGVD29)") 
```

Composite rainfall was coverted from in/day into ft3/day for the water budget model. 

```{r, fig.cap="Rainfall ft3/day"}
variableLinePlot("rainFinal_ftday", "Rainfall ft^3^/day")
```
\
*Figure XX: Rainfall ft^3^/day*

Evaporation data was collected at Lake Starr over the period 1998-2012. The GOES ET data was used in the water budget model since it was very comprable to the USGS data as well as was consistent over the period of record used by the water budget model.

```{r, fig.cap="Evaporation USGS Study ft^3^/day"}
variableLinePlot("evapStarrUSGS_ftday", "Evaporation ft^3^/day")
```
\
*Figure XX: Evaporation ft^3^/day*

Leakage from the lake was captured by a coefficient to determine the interaction between the underlying aquifer and the lake. 

```{r, fig.cap="Leakage ft3/day"}
variableLinePlot(c("leakage_ft3day"), "Leakage ft^3^/day")
```

variableLinePlot(c("inflowSASSTUSE_ft3day", "inflowSASWTS1_ft3day"), 'SAS Flow ft^3/day')
```

## Rainfall Regression Model


# Limitations
Several limitations were present within the developement of the water budget model. 

## Adjustment for centroid of lake
There first limitation is the inexact adjustment to the Hart UFA well to adjust to the centroid of the lake. Given the steep contours of the UFA over the area of the lake, generalizations were made for the adjustment. The adjustment of 4 feet would lead to incrased leakance at the lake. 

## Non-unique water budget solution
Water budgets are developed for many applications including lake augmentation projects, reservoir projects, hydrologic studies, etc. Often limited data suggests an estimation of many of the variables present within water budget models. Sensitivity analysis on the water budget model estimates the impact of individual parameters and data on the lake levels. Limited time for the development of the water budget models often restricts the sensitivity analysis to very course estimations. To further refine the MFL water budgets, sensitivity analysis could be performed on the resulting model and uncertainty quanitified for individual parameters and variables. 

## Composite rainfall data for rainfall regression model
Rainfall stations exist in various conditions and record completeness. When developing the rainfall regression models, several rainfall stations are selected based on the proximity to the lake of interest. Currently the rainfall dataset is developed by using the nearest rainfall dataset and when rainfall data is not available, the next nearest rainfall station with data is used. As such, a composite rainfall dataset is used for the develpoment of the model. Beset practice would use one rainfall dataset for both the calibrated and predicted portions of the regression model. 

## ECFT model output
The ECFT model was developed for regional water supply planning for Central Florida. This model has been applied to other circustances at a more local scale. The validation process at the local level has posed several problems for the development of the drawdown due to pumping. The uncertainty within the model should be incapsulated on considered when using the results to provide guidance to the MFL process.
